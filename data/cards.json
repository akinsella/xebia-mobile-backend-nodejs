Arjen Poutsma originally formulated the principle as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If something is too complex for <strong>me</strong> to understand it must be wrong</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The card was reformulated to be more generally applicable. Note the correspondence with a famous quote from Calvin and Hobbes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> As far as I'm concerned, if something is so complicated that you can't explain it in 10 seconds, then it's probably not worth knowing anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"poutsma-principle-Motivation\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>Sticking to this principle means that you will not allow things that you don't understand to survive. In some cases, the exercise of proving something wrong will result in understanding rather than proof, in some cases it will simply result in proof.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"poutsma-principle-Applicability\"></a>Applicability</h3>\n<p>Use this principle to attack parts of the code base that are no go areas or considered dangerous to change based on no apparent good reasons. The principle can also be applied to processes and rules in organizations to help them change.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"poutsma-principle-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>Write a testcase. In an organization rather than a code base your only weapon is reason, so you have to create a solid argument that proves the complexity is in fact wrong.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"poutsma-principle-Consequences\"></a>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Not allowing complexity to remain unchallenged takes time and effort. We cannot attack all problems that we encounter. It is better to challenge one thing fully then to challenge many things but failing to provide any proof. This means that a few complexities will be taken out, and some are left for another day.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"poutsma-principle-Samples\"></a>Samples</h3>\n<p>In the early days of Spring Integration developers struggled with the model of allowing both chains of endpoints and connections between endpoints through channels. We also had DirectChannel that worked both ways (send and receive). This meant that we had channels implementing MessageSource and MessageTarget and endpoints implementing similar interfaces. Through the application of the original Poutsma principle we ended up with a simple and clear solution: anything in the framework is related to either a Message, an Endpoint, or a Channel.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"poutsma-principle-References\"></a>References</h3>\n<p>Related Cards: Other cards that have some relationship with the card; discussion of the differences between the card and similar cards.

This can lead to embarrassing situations where you need to fix a hard problem under high pressure. Not good. If you apply these simple rules you will avoid this.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"thread-safe-Applicability\"></a>Applicability</h3>\n<p>Whenever you use objects in multiple threads they must be thread safe. This can go for services that are shared, but also for value objects that are passed along.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"thread-safe-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>The only risk of thread unsafe code is that state is not appropriately shared, so all the rules apply to state.</p>\n<p>The first rule applies to services. If an object simply doesn't hold any state it is always thread safe. Virtually all applications must hold state to be useful. In particular services need to collaborate with other services. The rules are bent usually, when people say \"stateless service\" they usually mean \"services that don't hold any state, but the immutable references to other services\".</p>\n<p>Immutable objects are usually the objects passed around in an application. If the state in an object cannot be changed after creation, there is no risk of one client seeing a different state than another. Creating an object as being immutable should be the default choice. Anything that mutates state is potentially dangerous.</p>\n<p>Encapsulated locks is the last resort. If an object has to be changed during its lifetime, this is the only way to ensure thread safety. Locking on the object itself is also thread safe, but it can cause unwanted locking and even deadlocks if others are locking on it too.</p>\n<p>Non thread safe code is not a problem in many situations. As long as objects are not shared with multiple threads, making them thread safe is adding complexity that is not needed. Many web applications are built around non thread safe domains, and this is not a problem. Be sure to make it clear that code is not thread safe and will not be used out of the safe context it is supposed to be used in.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"thread-safe-References\"></a>References</h3>\n<p>Brian Goetz: Java Concurrency in Practice</p>"

Then management agreed to not have the retrospective and planning meeting and just carry on for one more week. At the end of that week it turned out that most of the functionality was not according to the expectations. Not only did the team fail the previous sprint, but they also failed to properly plan this one. As a result two sprints were lost instead of one. The worst effect however was that the team got out of their rhythm and continued to have lower productivity and decreased motivation in the subsequent sprints.</p>"

For example, use the INFO level to report the actual (as used) configuration settings during start-up and inform of system status changes such as \"Started successfully\" or \"Shutdown initiated by &lt;admin name&gt;\". Use the WARNING level to report things that a developer or operator should look at, but that don't threaten the immediate operation. Use the ERROR level to report things that need immediate action, such as an unreachable database or a backed up message queue. Use the DEBUG level for everything else. You should be able to tie a pager to ERROR events and not lose sleep over trivialities.</p>\n<h4 id=\"clean-logs-Logeverymessageonce\">Log every message once</h4>\n<p>Anything more than that adds confusion and wastes disk space. It's quite common for exceptions to be logged more than once. Avoid this if you can.</p>\n<h4 id=\"clean-logs-Throwmeaningfulexceptions\">Throw meaningful exceptions</h4>\n<p>An exception message in your log file is of no use if it doesn't help you figure out what's wrong. Use a clear message and provide context. Use custom exception types so that different groups of problem types can be handled separately in different catch blocks.</p>\n<h4 id=\"clean-logs-Keepauditinginformationseparately\">Keep auditing information separately</h4>\n<p>The audit trail should have its own, dedicated destination (log file, database, what have you). The audit trail often has different archiving demands than the application log file.</p>\n<h4 id=\"clean-logs-Don'tcrywolf\">Don't cry wolf</h4>\n<p>If your log file raises a lot of false alarms, it will get ignored and any <em>real</em> problems won't become apparent until the phones start ringing.</p>\n<p>Don't put yourself in a position where you have to say \"Please ignore those exceptions you see in the logs, they are normal\". An exception stack trace stands out like a sore thumb in any log file. If you work with functional exceptions, you have to catch them and handle them in a way they do not appear in your technical logs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"clean-logs-Allowtuningofarunningsystem\">Allow tuning of a running system</h4>\n<p>For long running systems, consider embedding some troubleshooting hooks, like the ability to generate more verbose logging; possibly tied to a specific user session. Know how to get a thread dump and a heap dump out of a running JVM. If your software enforces a maximum number of sessions for each user account, make sure there's an admin function to delete active sessions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clean-logs-Consequences\">Consequences</h3>\n<h3 id=\"clean-logs-Samples\">Samples</h3>\n<h3 id=\"clean-logs-References\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Code complete, 2nd Edition.

Since everyone makes mistakes we reduce the risk of mistakes escaping to production by reviewing all code. Together with <a href=\"pair-programming\">Pair Programming</a> this practice ensures that always two pairs of eyes have seen all production code.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"code-review-Applicability\"></a>Applicability</h3>\n<p>Reviewing code is a great way to get an overview of a code base; to learn the style and the domain. It is also a way to view the code from an unusual standpoint and see inconsistencies that would otherwise stay out of focus. The only way to truly know the internal quality of a code base is to read the code. Apply reviews when you're not sure about the code quality, or when you want to coach a team to better quality code through concrete feedback.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"code-review-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>Reviewing can be done in several ways. First there is the old fashioned way: just take a text editor (with highlighting if you can) and read the code file by file. It can be useful to load the code in an IDE, but since you're not here to check if it will compile this might just as well be an unneeded distraction. While reading the code write down concretely what you would change if you were refactoring. Share this with the developers through a simple text.</p>\n<p>Then there is the per commit reviewing style, that allows the reviewer to review changes rather than the end result. This is perfect for quick feedback on developer behavior, rather than the result of the behavior. It takes more time and discipline to review all commits.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"code-review-Consequences\"></a>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Increased shared ownership is attained when reviewing is done by team members. When reviews are done it is important to invest time in dealing with the comments. Otherwise the (sometimes mundane) task of reviewing is not rewarded properly and will feel like a waste of time.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"code-review-Samples\"></a>Samples</h3>\n<p>There are tools that help reviewing greatly, such as Crucible (comercial) and of free tools around the git vcs, like gerrit and the github review system. Especially when reviewing per commit, decent tooling is a must have.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"code-review-References\"></a>References</h3>\n<p>\n<a href=\"pair-programming\">pair-programming</a>\n</p>"

Especially in a situation where you will potentially be held accountable for your actions having a good reason for them is essential. Proving that something is broken before you fiddle with it is mandatory, in code this means changing or creating a test first and only then changing the code. There is still some discussion on the effectiveness of test driven development. Measurements are not entirely conclusive, suggesting that there are situations where test driven development is not applicable. We suggest to at least ensure there is an objective way to verify the results of the change (keeping some leeway in the method).</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"no-test-no-bugfix-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>Whenever we attempt a change, we first figure out if we can prove that we've succeeded when we are done with our change.

A developer went into the code and changed the parser to deal differently with a certain character. A few weeks later another parsing issue was logged; another developer went in and changed the logic back. Both developers saw from the single example in the issue that their fix would solve the problem for the particular example. Then the first bug was reopened and the first developer got furious. He reverted the change that removed his check and committed. Then a bit later the second bug was reopened.

Be prepared to allow yourself and your team members to have some time alone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alone-time-Motivation\">Motivation</h3>\n<p>Even though we love pair programming, we can't expect anyone to constantly think out loud. When some seriously deep thinking needs to happen, or you just need to fiddle with something to find the right questions to ask; pair programming can block you. For these situations and just to keep the joy of solving a puzzle in isolation in the work alone time is great.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alone-time-Applicability\">Applicability</h3>\n<p>Any work on a problem that is not resulting in production code might be a candidate for some alone time. In particular when you get into a situation as a pair that you're both looking at the other guy for ideas it might be time to split up, scour the internet fret with some ideas and reconvene when you've found some clues. Doing nothing is also a very important part of creative work. Alone time might be needed even if there is no work that deserves being done by someone on their own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alone-time-Application\">Application</h3>\n<p>Timebox alone time. Make a date with a pair buddy before you go off on what might very well be a wild goose chase. Then when the timebox is over assess the situation with someone else. The harder the problem is, the harder it will be initially to get somewhere. Sometimes great ideas come to you while you're ironing your shirt or making a sandwich. Sometimes staring out of a window for a couple of hours is the most productive thing you can do. Setting up rules for how people should spend alone time defeats the purpose.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alone-time-Consequences\">Consequences</h3>\n<p>Enforced pairing should not be for 100% of the time. Alone time gives the brain time to recharge and ideas time to react with each other. All production code should be written in pairs. It follows that we must not plan people to work in pairs on production code 40 hours a week. 100% efficiency is unhealthy in creative teams.</p>"

In our industry, it is not uncommon to ignore the fallacies of distributed computing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The network is reliable.</li>\n<li>Latency is zero.</li>\n<li>Bandwidth is infinite.</li>\n<li>The network is secure.</li>\n<li>Topology doesn't change.</li>\n<li>There is one administrator.</li>\n<li>Transport cost is zero.</li>\n<li>The network is homogeneous.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ignoring these properties will lead to brittle systems. We don't want to create brittle systems; we want to create robust systems. Systems that survive network failure. Systems that do not need he constant presence of a network administrator in order to survive. Systems that are resilient to changes to the network topology. </p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"fallacies-distributed-computing-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>First of all, you need to be aware of the existence of this list and understand that there is no such thing as a free ride. When the network is getting involved, <em>you need to be be aware of the consequences</em>, and design for it.</p>\n<p>In addition to that: Many attempts have been made to hide the complexity of coping with the characteristics of a distributed system. Be careful with those solutions. Solutions that suggest that you should not worry about the network and allow you to create software as though the network wasn't there are suspicious. </p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"fallacies-distributed-computing-Consequences\"></a>Consequences</h3>\n<p>It is one thing to be <em>aware of the consequences</em> of your decisions when designing for a distributed solution. By carefully choosing from your options, you <em>can</em> most definitely increase the resilience of your system against network failures. However, increasing the robustness of your system might also increase the complexity of the programming model. </p>\n<p>Jini is an example of a technology that definitely took the 8 fallacies of distributed computing seriously, and I think it's fair to say it was much more resilient to networking issues than Java EE solutions coming about around that same timeframe. However, it <em>did</em> put a burden to the developer. You had to write more code in order to be able to deal with whatever could go wrong. </p>\n<p>Now, question is if your solutions <em>always</em> need to have the same properties as Jini-based solutions, especially if there is a price you will have to pay for it. Probably not. In the end, it's just a balancing act, balancing factors such as the price business is willing to pay for ultimate availability, the characteristics of the data center(s) and the experience of the team you are working with.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"fallacies-distributed-computing-References\"></a>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing\">Wikipedia</a>\n</li>\n</ul>"

Needless to say that bugs like these are really hard to debug. You need to be aware of the fact that behaviour <strong>can</strong> change as a consequence of your attempt to understand its root cause.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"heisenbergs-principle-Applicability\"></a>Applicability</h3>\n<p>There is no golden rule for the situation in which Heisenbugs can turn up - which makes them even harder to trap. Just to give you some examples of situations in which Heisenbugs might occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are stepping through a thread that may cause racing conditions when executing normally.</li>\n<li>By attaching a debugger, you are influencing some properties of the Java VM's normal execution: setting watches might suggest more synchronization than what you would have in normal circumstances, the overhead of having the debugger attached might alter the amount of memory normally available to your application, etc.</li>\n<li>If you test code by basically using a loopback type of construct (calling from your test into application code running in the same VM), there is a risk of sharing a lock that would never be shared if you call your application code remotely, from another VM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Heisenbugs are nasty, because your code might run successfully while testing or debugging, while it might fail when running in production. At Xebia, we care about having all your code tested. You <em>do</em> however need to make sure that you are testing the right thing. There is no excuse for not writing tests, but having tests running to completion successfully is no excuse for failing production code.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"heisenbergs-principle-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>So, what are you going to do about it? How do you prevent bugs like these from appearing in your code, and how do you spot their appearance. There's more than just a single word of advice on that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mimic the production environment as closely as possible while running your test. (Consider if there are any differences between the hardware running the tests and the hardware running your code in production.)</li>\n<li>If you have a bug, never stop chasing it until you have a test that reproduces it.</li>\n<li>Don't rely on coincidence for recreating the bug in your test. It might be that you can reproduce the bug by putting in a Thread.sleep() on your system, while on the system of your buddy it never shows up, since his system is executing faster or slower. If it's about concurrency related bugs, use <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/\">MultithreadedTC</a> to forcefully recreate the different states in which your running code might end up being.</li>\n<li>Understand Java's memory model.</li>\n<li>Understand the differences between Java code running on different platforms.</li>\n<li>Be aware of the limitation of line and branch coverage reports: they might show that your test code hit a particular branch or line, but it doesn't factor in differences in the state of the rest of your application. In other words, 100% branch and line coverage and a successful build does not mean you don't have Heisenbugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"heisenbergs-principle-Consequences\"></a>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Following the advice above, has a couple of consequences. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having tests run on your own system only might no longer be enough to proof correctness of your program.

      "fullContent": "<h3 id=\"curiosity-Motivation\">Motivation</h3>\n<p>Four reasons why curiosity is important:</p>\n<p>\n<em>It makes your mind active instead of passive</em>\n<br />\nCurious people always ask questions and search for answers in their minds. Their minds are always active. Since the mind is like a muscle which becomes stronger through continual exercise, the mental exercise caused by curiosity makes your mind stronger and stronger.</p>\n<p>\n<em>It makes your mind observant of new ideas</em>\n<br />\nWhen you are curious about something, your mind expects and anticipates new ideas related to it. When the ideas come they will soon be recognized. Without curiosity, the ideas may pass right in front of you and yet you miss them because your mind is not prepared to recognize them. Just think, how many great ideas may have lost due to lack of curiosity?</p>\n<p>\n<em>It opens up new worlds and possibilities</em>\n<br />\nBy being curious you will be able to see new worlds and possibilities which are normally not visible. They are hidden behind the surface of normal life, and it takes a curious mind to look beneath the surface and discover these new worlds and possibilities.</p>\n<p>\n<em>It brings excitement into your life</em>\n<br />\nThe life of curious people is far from boring. It's neither dull nor routine. There are always new things that attract their attention, there are always new 'toys' to play with. Instead of being bored, curious people have an adventurous life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"curiosity-Applicability\">Applicability</h3>\n<p>Applies to every aspect of your work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"curiosity-Application\">Application</h3>\n<p>\n<em>1. Keep an open mind</em>\n</p>\n<p>This is essential if you are to have a curious mind.&nbsp;Be open to learn, unlearn, and relearn. Some things you know and believe might be wrong, and you should be prepared to accept this possibility and change your mind.</p>\n<p>\n<em>2. Don't take things as granted</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you just accept the world as it is without trying to dig deeper, you will certainly lose the 'holy curiosity'. Never take things as granted. Try to dig deeper beneath the surface of what is around you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>3. Ask questions relentlessly</em>\n</p>\n<p>A sure way to dig deeper beneath the surface is asking questions: What is that? Why is it made that way? When was it made? Who invented it? Where does it come from? How does it work?What, why when who where and how are the best friends of curious people.</p>\n<p>\n<em>4. Don't label something as boring</em>\n</p>\n<p>Whenever you label something as boring, you close one more door of possibilities. Curious people are unlikely to call something as boring. Instead, they always see it as a door to an exciting new world. Even if they don't yet have time to explore it, they will leave the door open to be visited another time.</p>\n<p>\n<em>5. See learning as something fun</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you see learning as a burden, there's no way you will want to dig deeper into anything. That will just make the burden heavier. But if you think of learning as something fun, you will naturally want to dig deeper. So look at life through the glasses of fun and excitement and enjoy the learning process..</p>\n<p>\n<em>6. Read diverse kinds of reading</em>\n</p>\n<p>Don't spend too much time on just one world; take a look at another worlds. It will introduce you to the possibilities and excitement of the other worlds which may spark your interest to explore them further. One easy way to do this is through reading diverse kinds of reading. Try to pick a book or magazine on a new subject and let it feed your mind with the excitement of a new world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"curiosity-Consequences\">Consequences</h3>\n<p>Make sure curiosity is not making you loose focus. Also be aware that some things simply are not your business. Don't confuse curiosity with nosiness. </p>\n<h3 id=\"curiosity-References\">References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>4 Reasons Why Curiosity is Important</em>, Donald Latumahina, <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/4-reasons-why-curiosity-is-important-and-how-to-develop-it.html\">http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/4-reasons-why-curiosity-is-important-and-how-to-develop-it.html</a>\n</li>\n</ol>"

As a result, items turning up on the backlog are mostly related to a feature (as in, something the user can do) rather than overall quality. From the product owner's perspective, the team might be making good progress, whereas in reality what is getting produced will never be able to cope with what can be expected to happen when going live.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"non-functionals-Applicability\"></a>Applicability</h3>\n<p>Every project should carefully consider the quality related attributes that need to be addressed. That does not necessarily mean that all projects need have the same non-functional requirements. In fact, in some cases, after short but conscious consideration, the decision might be to just ignore non-functional requirements altogether. (In case of a one-off script?)</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"non-functionals-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>Setting proper objectives for non-functionals is not easy. The problem is: your product owner (ideally the money owner) might have a hard time understanding what these quality attributes are all about. Yet, at the same time, you want to make sure that the product owner backs the plan to address a particular quality requirement, so you <em>do</em> want him to understand what he is essentially asking for.</p>\n<p>One way to address it is by avoiding scales that are (mostly) well understood by developers, but not by non-IT people. So, you just define your own scales that are meaningful in the minds of the product owners. In some cases, that means defining some higher-order quality requirements, from which you then derive the lower-level quality requirements with related measurable scales that can be translated in actual work to be done.</p>\n<p>One way or the other, the quality requirements eventually need to be translated into user stories, or be woven into the definition of done of other stories. You need the product owner's awareness of the fact that you are going to work on this, and you <em>do</em> want him to understand the relevance of it all.</p>\n<p>One of the best sources of working this way is probably Gilb's 'Competitive Engineering'. You might not need to adopt his language. In most cases, it will be fine to define your own, one that is based on terminology that is well understood by the team. Aim for the riskiest non-functional requirements first.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"non-functionals-Consequences\"></a>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Spending time on working out the quality requirements with your product owner is going to take time.

Start early, and refine the requirements iteratively.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"non-functionals-References\"></a>References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em><a href=\"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ejxQF60xVV0C&amp;dq=competitive+engineering&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=UMSATPmeF4L_Ocq-rNIJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Competitive Engineering</a></em>, Tom Gilb, 2005</li>\n</ul>"

It's a good general guideline, but it may not always be feasible, especially in maintenance projects.</p>\n<h4 id=\"comment-with-care-Don'trepeatthecode-clarifyitsintent.\">Don't repeat the code - clarify its intent.</h4>\n<p>Code Complete [1] illustrates this with a nice example. Which is more clarifying?</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<h4 id=\"comment-with-care-Documentsurprisesandworkarounds.\">Document surprises and workarounds.</h4>\n<p>\"Surprises and workarounds\" is deliberately vague, as it's very hard to qualify. A common scenario is that you add a special case in a method to fix a bug or when you find out that a library behaves differently than you thought it would because it bites you during testing.</p>\n<p>An example of this is when I found out that a Java 1.5 <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> with a <code>corePoolSize</code> of 0, a <code>maxPoolSize</code> of 50 and an unbounded task queue does not idle at 0 threads and execute at 50, but rather, starts 0 threads and executes nothing at all. When I dug into this, I found out that Java 1.5 has no way to make a <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> idle at 0 threads (Java 1.6 does) and that in both versions <code>maxPoolSize</code> is meaningless with an unbounded queue. I put a short note above the variable declaration to benefit any maintenance programmer that needs to adjust the pool sizes.</p>\n<p>A special case of this is where source code analysis tools report a false positive. The flagship example of this is the <a href=\"http://digitaloffense.net/tools/debian-openssl/\">Debian OpenSSL fiasco</a> of a few years back. The random number generator contained what appears to be bad use of uninitialized memory (and was reported as such by code analysis tools), but which was essential to seeding the random number generator. Someone removed the line in a clean-up effort and the result was two years' worth of SSL certificates each of which could be brute-forced in at most 32768 attempts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"comment-with-care-Makeeverycommentcount.\">Make every comment count.</h4>\n<p>Excessive comments are just clutter.</p>\n<h4 id=\"comment-with-care-Thejava.util.concurrentpackage\">\n<img alt=\"(thumbs up)\" class=\"emoticon emoticon-thumbs-up\" data-emoticon-name=\"thumbs-up\" src=\"/confluence/s/en_GB/3391/c989735defd8798a9d5e69c058c254be2e5a762b.2/_/images/icons/emoticons/thumbs_up.png\" /> The <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package</h4>\n<p>The JavaDoc comments in the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package are outstanding.

Worse, the comments don't add any value: we know what a getter or setter does and if a method does something else it shouldn't masquerade as a getter or setter in the first place. Don't generate comments using this template, just leave them out.</p>\n<p>If your architect/analysis tool/spouse won't let you get away with undocumented getters and setters, at least replace the template by something grammatically correct.</p>\n<h4 id=\"comment-with-care-Unit,bounds,resolution,precision\">\n<img alt=\"(thumbs up)\" class=\"emoticon emoticon-thumbs-up\" data-emoticon-name=\"thumbs-up\" src=\"/confluence/s/en_GB/3391/c989735defd8798a9d5e69c058c254be2e5a762b.2/_/images/icons/emoticons/thumbs_up.png\" /> Unit, bounds, resolution, precision</h4>\n<p>When dealing with measurements and amounts, make sure the unit, resolution and bounds are apparent.

Failing that, you can resort to code comments such as in the next example.</p>\n<p>The <code>xsd:dateTime</code> has a resolution in seconds (optionally milliseconds) and an optional UTC offset. The UTC offset is required to unambiguously pinpoint a calendar date and time on the time continuum. If the actual offset is unavailable, a time zone is the next best thing.

Writing the code while keeping in mind how you're going to test it <em>will</em> change the way you write your code. There is a fair chance you want to test your module in isolation. That imposes some restrictions on the design of your module: it forces you to minimize coupling as much as possible. And as it turns out, that's a desirable property of software any way. </p>\n<p>The reverse effect obviously also occurs when you are writing the test. You don't just write random test code. You carefully consider the different states in which your module might end up being in, and you adjust your way of testing around that. </p>\n<h3 id=\"test-code-one-Applicability\">Applicability</h3>\n<p>Always. This is one of the reasons why having accepting test criteria associated with your user stories is important. </p>\n<h3 id=\"test-code-one-Application\">Application</h3>\n<p>There are two ways of writing your code. You either start with your code, or you start with your test. Test driven development is about starting with your test, <em>and never start writing code before you have a test that is failing</em>. That way, your code basically flows from your tests. Consequently, your code is influence by the tests only, and not the other way around. </p>\n<p>My personal suggestion would be to go back and forth between your code and your tests. </p>\n<h3 id=\"test-code-one-Consequences\">Consequences</h3>\n<p>Circling around between test and code might make it harder to define a stop criterion. And 80% test coverage rule might help. Geting up to 100% test coverage will be hard or (in many cases) impossible. Using assertions inside your code will definitely help to make up for the remaining 20%. Testing your code forces you to take some design decision consciously; adding assertions will have the same effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-code-one-References\">References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>The Way of Testivus - Unit Testing Wisdom From An Ancient Software Start-up</em>, Albert Savoia, <a href=\"http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf\">http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf</a>, 2007</li>\n</ol>"

The modeling of the test automation should be done in collaboration between testers and developers.

So, coupling is all about the relation <em>between</em> modules. Tightly coupled systems have a number of undesirable properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in one module tend to have a ripple effect on other modules. (So it's hard to make isolated changes.)</li>\n<li>It will be hard to test a module in isolation.</li>\n<li>It will be hard to reuse a module in an alternative context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Cohesion</em> is a measure of how strongly-related or focused the responsibilities of a single module are. Systems with minimal cohesion have a number of undesirable properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(When applied to source code) code tends to be less readable.</li>\n<li>Code is likely to be less reusable in alternative contexts.</li>\n<li>Complexity is high. (It's hard to figure out what belongs where and why.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a consequence, you should <em>minimize</em> coupling and <em>maximimze</em> cohesion when designing your modules.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximize-cohesion-minimize-coupling-Applicability\">Applicability</h3>\n<p>\n<em>Minimal coupling, maximal cohesion</em> is applicable to many contexts. Traditionally, it's often associated to source code level design practices, but it is <em>by no means restricted</em> to that context. Many people have argued that it is equally applicable in enterprise scale problems <sup><a href=\"#maximize-cohesion-minimize-coupling-sessions\">2</a></sup>, and I have no problem considering it applicable to hardware design as well. The standardization of USB, PCI, memory modules - it all seems to be driven by a desire to minimize coupling (allowing us to use it in many contexts) as well a maximizing cohesion (this piece of hardware serves one function only).</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximize-cohesion-minimize-coupling-Application\">Application</h3>\n<p>In order to maximize cohesion, make sure you are <em>always</em> able to summarize the purpose of a single module in a single phrase. If it turns out to be impossible to capture the purpose of a module into a single discriminative phrase, then that's a smell. At the other hand, don't go totally overboard by making everything a separate module; it will have a dramatic effect on the number of dependencies between modules, and therefore hurt you in terms of coupling.</p>\n<p>One of the tools that might help you organizing your dependencies is the Dependency Structure Matrix.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximize-cohesion-minimize-coupling-Consequences\">Consequences</h3>\n<p>Applying this principle makes it more likely that pieces of your software will survive over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximize-cohesion-minimize-coupling-References\">References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>Structured Design</em>, W.

It's questionable if a picture really says more than a thousand words (I personally think a thousand words actually say more), but a proper visualization does a much better job <em>capturing the essence</em>.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"make-it-visible-Applicability\"></a>Applicability</h3>\n<p>Visualization is a tool that comes in handy in all sorts of circumstances. Dan Roam cuts the problem solving process into four phases, and suggests visualization techniques to help you through each of these phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Looking</em> = Collecting and screening</li>\n<li>\n<em>Seeing</em> = Selecting and clumping</li>\n<li>\n<em>Imagining</em> = Seeing what isn't there</li>\n<li>\n<em>Showing</em> = Making it all clear</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"make-it-visible-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>\n<strong>Don't hesitate</strong>\n</p>\n<p>First of all, if you are convinced that you have a way of using visualization to show what's out there, to reveal patterns, to compare some ideas or to sell a particular one, then you don't hesitate; <em>you just do it</em>. For some people, that's harder than others. However, Dan Roam is convinced everyone can do it. All you need to be able to do is draw a line, draw a circle, a face and some arrows.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Where to start</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you don't know where to start, it might be good to check the <a href=\"#make-it-visible-codex\">Visual Thinking Codex</a>. It offers suggestions on the kind of pictures to use in various circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Stick it on the wall</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A visualization is not going to be helpful at all if it sits somewhere on a network drive. It should be <em>out there in the open</em>, for everyone to see. Don't hesitate to use the space surrounding you or your audience. Stick it on the wall, plaster the elevator, be creative.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Hand-drawn, informal and casual</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Consider casual, hand-drawn, informal and even messy in favor of smooth, formal, polished and tool generated. There are many reasons why. First of all, in most cases, jotting something down by hand is just going to be <em>way faster</em> than by using a tool. If a hand-drawn picture tells as much as a tool-drawn picture, then spending hours on getting something fancy is just <em>waste</em>.</p>\n<p>Other than that, hand-drawn, informal and improvised pictures are often easier to remember than cold, formal and tool-generated diagrams.</p>\n<p>And last but not least, collective design efforts result in hand-drawn, informal and improvised type of diagrams any way. At the end of a collective design effort, when there is consensus on how to move forward based on an informal diagram drawn on a whiteboard, what would be the value of turning it into a formal diagram. The hand-drawn diagram is still imprinted on everyone's retina. Chances are that turning it into a formal diagram is only going to make it harder for people to understand.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you want tools any way</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Here are some of the tools we use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Omnigraffle: informal but pretty.</li>\n<li>Graphviz: not that pretty, but extremely convenient in taking care of the heavy-lifting.</li>\n<li>Google Visualization API: pretty decent, again very convenient for preventing you from having to manually draw the same diagram over and over again.</li>\n<li>Protovis: if you are into automating things, then Protovis draws awesome pictures, but it might be a little harder to use than - say - Google visualizations.</li>\n<li>Raphael: if neither Google nor Protovis support the kind of diagrams you want to generate, Raphael is your next best option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"make-it-visible-Samples\"></a>Samples</h3>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"make-it-visible-References\"></a>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>The Back of a Napkin</em>, Dan Roam</li>\n<li>\n<em>Gapminder</em>, <a href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/\">http://www.gapminder.org/</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Notation and Representation in Collaborative Object-Oriented Design</em>, Uri Dekel and Herbsleb</li>\n<li>\n<em>Protovis</em>, <a href=\"http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/\">http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Google Visualization API</em>, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/charttools/index.html\">http://code.google.com/apis/charttools/index.html</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Raphaël</em>, <a href=\"http://raphaeljs.com/\">http://raphaeljs.com/</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"confluence-anchor-link\" id=\"make-it-visible-codex\"></span> The Visual Thinking Codex_, Dan Roam, <a href=\"http://www.thebackofthenapkin.com/pdf/TBOTN_codex.pdf\">http://www.thebackofthenapkin.com/pdf/TBOTN_codex.pdf</a>\n</li>\n</ol>"

If you are able to complete something early, you can move it into production and start feeding the ROI into the development of next features. If you are working on many things at the same time, you are basically denying yourself money.</p>\n<p>Other than that, doing many things at the same time comes with a cost. If a computer has to do many things at the same time, it will waste cycles switching between these different tasks. Your brain is not any different. Doing many tasks at the same time is like a juggling act. Juggling is way easier with just one ball. Juggling with just one ball is not only easier. It also increases that likeliness you will be able to complete your act without letting it drop on the floor.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"one-feature-at-a-time-Applicability\"></a>Applicability</h3>\n<p>More often than not.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"one-feature-at-a-time-Application\"></a>Application</h3>\n<p>Break the entire idea up into Minimal Marketable Features. You _could_ consider calculating the net present value of each of these features, as \"Software by Numbers\" suggests. Alternatively, you take a slightly less scientific approach, and just sort the stories in the order you expect them to return most value early on. (However, bear mind that some features would earn you way more if you implement them _now_, rather than later on. The approach suggested by \"Software by Numbers\" factors this in.)</p>\n<p>Once you understand desired order for releasing the minimal marketable features, it's just a matter of feeding that to your teams in the appropriate order, and make sure the definition of done is clearly communicated. If we say \"one feature at a time\", we really mean \"one feature at a time\". In other words, that one features should really be completed, as much as possible. Getting it out there might require a bit more effort, but you will also enjoy the benefits of tapping into revenue streams early on.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"one-feature-at-a-time-Consequences\"></a>Consequences</h3>\n<p>Question is how you deal with \"one feature at a time\" if you have many teams working on the same product. The solution is not to redefine minimal to \"whatever these teams can accomplish\". It will require you to carefully consider the dependencies between these Minimal Marketable Features and minimize them as much as possible. That includes making sure the architecture allows these Minimal Marketable Features to be developed independently as much as possible.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the easiest (but not necessarily most desirable) way to distribute work on Minimal Marketable Features between teams would be to have teams focusing on a particular layer or tier of your architecture. However, as a consequence, your teams will no longer be focused on completing the minimal marketable feature. They will instead have time left to work on other features as well. Chances are that - in the end, with all of the painful coordination between teams - you are left with a number of half-baked half-completed features, instead of a couple of features that are ready to be put out there.</p>\n<p>Instead of having teams that focus on particular architectural layers and tiers, it might be worth considering teams capable of completing the entire minimal marketable feature on their own. That makes an architecture that accommodates this a more attractive option.</p>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"one-feature-at-a-time-References\"></a>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>Software by Numbers</em>, Mark Denne and Jane Cleland-Huang, <a href=\"http://www.softwarebynumbers.org/\">http://www.softwarebynumbers.org/</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Service Integration at the Presentation Layer</em>, Wilfred Springer, <a href=\"http://blog.xebia.com/2010/07/21/service-integration-at-the-presentation-layer/\">http://blog.xebia.com/2010/07/21/service-integration-at-the-presentation-layer/</a>\n</li>\n</ol>"

We developers are drawn into it like bugs into a bugzapper. We end up spending <em>way</em> too much time on things <em>we don't even need</em>. That's just wrong. We need somebody to get us back on track. And that's exactly what pair programming is going to give you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you pair, one person codes---the driver. The other person is the navigator, whose job is to think. As navigator, sometimes you think about what the driver is typing. (Don't rush to point out missing semicolons, though. That's annoying.) Sometimes you think about what tasks to work on next and sometimes you think about how your work best fits into the overall design.</p>\n<p>This arrangement leaves the driver free to work on the tactical challenges of creating rigorous, syntactically correct code without worrying about the big picture, and it gives the navigator the opportunity to consider strategic issues without being distracted by the details of coding. Together, the driver and navigator create higher-quality work more quickly than either could produce on their own.<sup><a href=\"#pair-programming-james_shore\">1</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"pair-programming-Applicability\">Applicability</h3>\n<p>Okay, there might be a few situations when you need some time alone. But, really, in all other cases, pair programming <em>is applicable</em>. That doesn't mean it's <em>easy</em> though. In fact, for most people, it turns out to be quite painful to say goodbye to their time spent in isolation, as evidenced by the type of response you will get when suggesting pair programming to die-hard alone coders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm faster on my own</li>\n<li>Can't pair with that guy, he's getting on my nerves</li>\n<li>Pair programming is too tiring</li>\n<li>We've split up the work and we'll get it done faster if we use two keyboards</li>\n<li>There's too much background noise</li>\n<li>I'm just slowing her down</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Iwein Fuld wrote a great article on the subject a in 2010, and this is what he said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of this might sound plausible, so let me axe that down first. No you're not faster on your own, you're just creating more crap for your colleagues to puzzle over and eventually delete. The code you write alone sucks. That guy that is getting on your nerves is trying to tell you (clumsily) that your code sucks, try to listen to him and you'll turn into a better programmer. Or maybe you can teach him something and he'll stop getting on your nerves. If your code is so simple that you can split up the work in advance you're writing it on too low an abstraction level, or you need to work on this in two pairs. If you're slowing the other guy down, that's a good thing. That will prevent him from writing code that you cannot maintain. If you don't feel worthy of your colleagues code, get over it, or get off the team.<sup><a href=\"#pair-programming-ifuld\">2</a></sup>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In some situations pair programming is not a good fit.

If your navigator is unable to read your screen, then it will fail. Getting another monitor might help. If - in order for the navigator to see the screen - the driver needs to work in a cramped position, it will fail as well. There are certain type of desks that just don't support pair programming at all. Rearrange the office floor to fix it. Make yourself comfortable.</li>\n<li>Pick a style.

It's not hard to come up with examples of bad API design. Java's XML processing libraries are notoriously awkward to use. Things that should be simple require tons of boilerplate code.</p>\n<p>Joshua Bloch presented his ideas on API design in a talk named 'How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters' at OOPSLA 2006. It comprises a set of criteria that are fairly easy to remember, as they are all small enough to fit on a bumper sticker:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All programmers are API designers</li>\n<li>APIs can be among your greatest assets or liabilities</li>\n<li>Public APIs, like diamonds, are forever</li>\n<li>APIs should be easy to use and hard to misuse</li>\n<li>APIs should be self-documenting</li>\n<li>When designing an API, first gather requirements - with a healthy degree of skepticism</li>\n<li>Structure requirements as use-cases</li>\n<li>Early drafts of APIs should be short</li>\n<li>Code the use-cases against your API before you implement it</li>\n<li>Maintain the code for use-cases as the API evolves</li>\n<li>Example code should be exemplary</li>\n<li>You can't please everyone so aim to displease everyone equally</li>\n<li>Expect API-design mistakes due to failures of your imagination</li>\n<li>API design is not a solitary activity</li>\n<li>Avoid fixed limites on input sizes</li>\n<li>Names matter</li>\n<li>If it's hard to find good names, go back to the drawing board</li>\n<li>When in doubt leave it out</li>\n<li>Keep APIs free of implementation details</li>\n<li>Minimize mutability</li>\n<li>Documentation matters</li>\n<li>Consider the performance of consequences of an API design decisions, but don't warp an API to achieve performance gains</li>\n<li>When in Rome, do as the Romans do</li>\n<li>Minimize accessibility</li>\n<li>Subclass only if you can say with a straight face that every instance of the subclass is an instance of the superclass</li>\n<li>Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it</li>\n<li>Don't make the client do anything the library could do</li>\n<li>Obey the principle of the last astonishment</li>\n<li>Fail fast</li>\n<li>Provide programmatic access to all data available in string form</li>\n<li>Overload with care</li>\n<li>Use the right data type for the job</li>\n<li>Use consistent parameter ordering across methods</li>\n<li>Avoid long parameter names</li>\n<li>Avoid return values that demand exceptional processing</li>\n<li>Throw exceptions only to indicate exceptional conditions</li>\n<li>Throw unchecked exceptions unless clients can realistically recover from the failure</li>\n<li>API design is an art, not a science</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"apis-are-forever-Applicability\">Applicability</h3>\n<p>Always.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apis-are-forever-Application\">Application</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use it while designing the API</li>\n<li>Use it while coding</li>\n<li>Use it while reviewing code</li>\n<li>Use it while pair programming</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It might be good idea to read the list before you go off to design something significant, or always have a printed version of the list close to where you are.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apis-are-forever-Consequences\">Consequences</h3>\n<p>The only negative consequence I can imagine related to trying to follow the guidelines given by Josh are - perhaps - analysis paralysis. Pair programming will prevent that. In fact, just by pair programming and have your buddy remind you of API design bumper stickers, you might have all the benefits without the chance of analysis paralysis.</p>\n<p>Now, some people might argue that following these standards doesn't address a particular business value for the customer, but then I disagree. It is your responsibility as a programmer to create good code. Don't be tempted to create something messy just because you are in a hurry. Chances are that - if you work like that - it will bite back and result in major head aches when you need to overhaul your code later on.</p>\n<p>In order to avoid any discussions on taking the time to work according the guidelines given above, consider making it part of your definition of done, and make sure everybody agrees on that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apis-are-forever-Samples\">Samples</h3>\n<p>Less than great API design samples, often serving in examples in Joshua Bloch's talk: JAXP</p>\n<h3 id=\"apis-are-forever-References\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/articles/API-Design-Joshua-Bloch\">InfoQ Article</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/presentations/effective-api-design\">Video recorded at JavaPolis</a>\n</li>\n</ul>"
