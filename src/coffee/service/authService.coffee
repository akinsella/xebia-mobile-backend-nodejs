# Passport session setup.
#   To support persistent login sessions, Passport needs to be able to
#   serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  Typically,
#   this will be as simple as storing the user ID when serializing, and finding
#   the user by ID when deserializing.  However, since this example does not
#   have a database of user records, the complete Google profile is serialized
#   and deserialized.
