Sam believes that a programming environment which has sufficient liveness, rapid feedback and tolerance of failure to support the live performance of music is an environment ripe for mining novel ideas that will not only benefit artistic practices themselves but also the computer industry more generally. In pursuit of this unique perspective Sam is the lead developer on a suite of open source tools: Overtone, a collaborative programmable music environment; Quil, an enhanced Clojure version of the visual language Processing; Emacs Live, a curated suite of Emacs tools, placing strong emphasis on live feedback and visual cues. Through this exploration Sam has been challenged to draw not only from his familiar territories of computer industry and academia but also from the arts, a combination Sam now believes to be essential for the development of well-researched, creative, innovative and practical ideas in this field.",
